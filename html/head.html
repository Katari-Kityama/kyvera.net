<h2>Head and Facial Anatomy</h2>
<p>The head of a kyvera is distinctly angular and features a large set of thin ears as well as their "cheek flaps" which either seem to be some exotic sensory organ or somehow aids in their inter-species communication.</p>

<h4>Ears</h4>
<p>Kyvera have large, thin ears that easily triple the spacial-footprint of their heads.</p>
<h4>Eyes</h4>
<p>Kyvera have cat-like eyes with massive pupils evolved for the long dark nights of planet Kenaria. Similar to a cat's eye, the pupil of a kyvera contracts into a slit shape when the eye is exposed to light, protecting their vision. However, due to their planets conditions, kyvera usually live in darkness or twilight with exceptions depending on their environment.</p>
<br>
<p>Also similar to the eye of a cat, the eye of a kyvera has a large iris that often completly hides the sclera, or the white/black of their eye. Unlike cats, the iris of a kyvera is biolumenecent and glows distinctly.</p>
<h4>Snout, Maw, and Teeth</h4>
<p>The snout and jaw of the kyvera is distinctly sharp, flat, and angular. </p>
<br>
<p>Nose types range considerably throughout the kyvera species and sub-species.</p>

<p>While kyvera do typically eat omnivorous diets, the species is clearly a descendent of some sort of carnivorous species and this is distinctly reflected with the shape, size and type of teeth inside of their long mouths. despite this, they have flatter molars better suited for grinding.</p>

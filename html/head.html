<h4>Ears</h4>
<p>Kyvera have large, thin ears that easily triple the spacial-footprint of their heads.</p>
<h4>Eyes</h4>
<p>Kyvera have large, cat-like eyes with massive pupils evolved for the long dark nights of planet Kenaria. Similar to a cat's eye, the pupil of a kyvera contracts into a slit shape when the eye is exposed to light, protecting their vision. However, due to their planets conditions, kyvera usually live in darkness or twilight with exceptions depending on their environment.</p>
<p>Also similar to the eye of a cat, the eye of a kyvera has a large iris that often completly hides the sclera, or the white/black of their eye. Unlike cats, the iris of a kyvera is biolumenecent and glows distinctly.</p>
<h4>Snout, Maw, and Teeth</h4>
<p>The snout and jaw of the kyvera is distinctly sharp, flat, and angular. </p>
<p>Nose types range considerably throughout the kyvera species and sub-species.</p>

<p>Kyvera are decendents of carnivores so their maws and teeth greatly resemble their anscestor species. However, kyvera are ombivores and consequently their teeth have adapted to a more flexible diet, especially their molars, which are flatter and are best suited for grinding.</p>

<h2>Chest and Back</h2>
<p>Their chest isn't very remarkable, but it is notably humanoid with some exceptions. It's smaller than a human chest and is often covered in lots of fur, especially if the subspecies is a furred-type.</p>
<h4>Back Armora</h4>
<p>Many kyvera have small armora plates running up their back and sometimes up to their neck. Compared to the plates on their tails, the back-armora is seemingly smaller, undeveloped, and useless. Kyvera are possibly deevolving this trait.</p>
<h4>Fur and Hair</h4>
<p>Fur length ranges wildly especially for the front of the chest and their necks. Kyvera in colder climates may tend to have more fur here, but these kyvera are also likely to be part of an undocumented subspecies.</p>

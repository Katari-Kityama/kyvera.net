# kyvera.net
### Kyvera website in development! 
##### To devs: 
The run.bat and run.command files allow for local website debugging via creating a simple local server. Try running the file to see what missing dependencies you need to install to use these debugging tools (NPX is a dependency).

The github will have 2 branches. the Main branch is the development branch. You can think of it as the alpha or the in progress portion of the website. 
The gh-pages branch is the live branch and is hosted publicly. This is our release branch and we will only push major updates to the website onto this branch.

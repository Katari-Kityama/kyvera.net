# UPDATE
This website is going to be solely coded by Katari Kityama during the time I am allowing this project to be a part of a school assignment. The text addressed to devs will not currently apply.

For teachers, graders, or TA's, I'm going to be recreating what little existed of this website and more using the knowledge I have gained in my class. 

# kyvera.net
### Kyvera website in development! 
##### To devs: 
The run.bat and run.command files allow for local website debugging via creating a simple local server. Try running the file to see what missing dependencies you need to install to use these debugging tools (NPX is a dependency).

The github will have 2 branches. the Main branch is the development branch. You can think of it as the alpha or the in progress portion of the website. 
The gh-pages branch is the live branch and is hosted publicly. This is our release branch and we will only push major updates to the website onto this branch.
